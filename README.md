### **The challenge**

Your challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## **My process**

---

### **Built with**

- HTML, CSS.

### **What I learned**

- The nuances creating for both mobile and desktop using @media queries. Moreover, recognizing the hierarchies within different properties in CSS.

- Had the opportunity to practice Flexbox with real-world examples.

### **Continued development**

- A more interactive interface; to have 'Add to Cart' active and usable, displaying the changes count. What if certain product is currently out of stock? Display the different sizes of the same bottle available.
